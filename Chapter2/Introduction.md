## Introduction to Operating Systems

* The `processor` fetches an instruction from memory, decodes it (i.e. it figures out which instruction) and executes is (like at 2 numbers together, access memory, check a condition, jump to a function, etc.). After it is done with that instruction, it moves onto the next one, and so on, until the program finally completes.



* These are the basics of the `Von Neumann` model of computing. This sounds simple until we consider all the other things going on in the system that makes it easy to use. 
There is actually a body of software that is actually making it easy to run programs known as the `operating system (OS)`.
